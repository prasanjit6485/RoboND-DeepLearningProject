### Introduction

In this project, I have build and trained fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation to classify target object from background and non-target objects. Utilized trained model to make drone follow target object in simulation.

### Network Architecture

Network architecture of fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation is shown below:
